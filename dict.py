# Problem statement: 

# You have a dictionary representing student grades: 

grades = {'Alice': 85, 'Bob': 92, 'Charlie': 78}


# 1) You need to add a new entry for a student
#    'David' with a grade of 88.
print (())
# 2) Also, you need to update 'Alice's grade to 90. 

# 3) What will be the updated dictionary?
print (grades)
grades['david']=88
grades.update({'rohan ':75})
grades['Alice']=90
print(grades)
