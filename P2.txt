Problem statement: 
You have a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a 
student's name and a list of their grades:

students = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'grades': [85, 92, 78]},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'grades': [88, 76, 90]},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'grades': [95, 82, 89]}
]

You need to compute the average grade for each student and 
create a new dictionary where the keys are the student names and 
the values are their average grades. 

What will be the resulting dictionary?
